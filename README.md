## Library:-
  This is a complete book-collection e-library Application with SQLite Database.
  Basically, It takes in the user input for the book details and stores it in a cart named "MY BOOkS". then if the user wants to mark the book as read or unread , then there is a facility to update MY BOOKS where user can mark the book as read or unread.
  If the user wants to remove any book from the MY BOOKS then there is an option for removing the book.
  
  ## milestone_2:-
  This Application is also a book-collection Application but it doesn't contain the SQLite database but instead it stores the books locally in MY BOOKS variable. 
  It works similarly as the Library application the only difference between both is the method of storing the data; the Library app. tores data in database and this app. stores data in a variable.
  
  ## Movies-Collection:-
  This Application works similarly as the Library app. but this app. is for movies. and it contains local database.
